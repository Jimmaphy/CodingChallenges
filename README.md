# CodingChallenges

Repository to store tiny projects I challenge
myself to when I have some spare time.
The challenges are listed below.
They are purely meant for practice and me
having some fun when I'm out and about.
There is one condition to the challenge:
it must be completed in a single sitting.

### Challenge 1: Visual Basic Todo App

Make a todo app in Visual Basic through Windows Forms.
The focus is to get an understanding of the VB syntax,
basic data manipulation and file management.
